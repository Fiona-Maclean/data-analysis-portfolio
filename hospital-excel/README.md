# Hospital Referrals Data Analysis (Excel)

This Excel workbook analyses referral and patient engagement data collected from an organisation supporting patients in hospitals.  
The data has been **synthesised and anonymised** — all numbers are made up so the workbook can be publicly shared — but the structure reflects **how real hospital data is organised**.  

The workbook demonstrates how data can be cleaned, structured, summarised, and visualised to provide meaningful insights.

It covers:

- How many referrals have been received by patients in each hospital over time  
- The types of referrals coming in  
- Referral rates for each hospital  
- The number of patients engaged at each hospital

## A selection of key outputs

**Referrals by Type**  
Shows how many referrals of each type were received. A pivot table summarises the counts, and a bar chart visualises differences. This helps understand which referral types are most common.

**Referrals by Month and Hospital**  
Tracks the number of referrals each hospital receives each month. The clustered bar chart highlights trends over time and shows which hospitals receive more referrals at different points in the year.
