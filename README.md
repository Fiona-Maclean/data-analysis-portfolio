# Data Analysis & Visualisation Portfolio – Fiona Maclean

This repository showcases selected data analysis projects using **Excel and Power BI**.  
It demonstrates my ability to structure, clean, and visualise data to produce clear insights, and to create interactive dashboards that tell a story for both technical and non-technical audiences.

The projects include work on hospital referral and patient engagement data, as well as higher education course data, highlighting skills in:

- Data cleaning and structuring  
- Pivot tables, calculated fields, and formulas in Excel  
- Interactive visualisations in Power BI  
- Trend analysis and insight communication
