# Postgraduate Computing Courses in Scotland (Power BI)

This Power BI dashboard analyses postgraduate computing courses offered by Scottish universities between 2014 and 2024.  
It provides insights into the number and types of courses offered, as well as student enrolments over time.

The dashboard includes:

- **Courses by Year and Type**  
  A stacked bar chart showing how many courses of each type were offered each year. This helps identify trends in course offerings across the decade.

- **Trends in Courses and Student Enrolments**  
  Line charts showing the number of courses and the number of students enrolled over time, split by full-time and part-time study. This makes it easy to see changes in demand.

- **Interactive Slicers**  
  Users can filter by university or course to explore the data in more detail.
